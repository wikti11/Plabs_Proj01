# JSON App

## Premise

The goal of this app was to read JSON files of given language. Then for each user-inserted word, the app will print out information about which language it comes from. 

## Specifications

Program should allow you to add your own language with list of words and save it as .json file. With the next launch each file created this way will be included in the program "database". Additionally the app saves PDF file with information about how many words were input by user as well as which language they came from. The program uses serialization and deserialization to process .json files. Additionally it has working test classes that have hard-coded miniature dictionaries. 

## Additional iformation

This project was created by me from October until November 2021 in IntelliJ IDEA using Java.
